Welcome Python Beginners! Lets get to work

Here's a quick-and-dirty guide to using Git for exercises:

1) If you haven't already, create a GitHub account (www.github.com)

2) Install Git on your computer (https://git-scm.com/downloads). Make sure to add it to your path

3) Fork the "pyBeginner" repository (https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

4) Navigate to http://github.com/"your-username-here"/pyBeginner (this is where your forked repository lives)

5) Clone the repository locally:
- Click the clipboard-looking button to the right of the url
- Open Command prompt in the directory where you'd like to store your exercises (i.e. go to D:\Users\"your name"\Documents\, hold shift + right-click, select "Open command window here")
- Enter the following: git clone https://github.com/"your-username-here"/pyBeginner.git
**This will add all files into that particular directory
- Edit all exercises to completion
- Upon completion, enter the following in the command window (in the correct directory): git add "file-name here"
- You need to commit the changes with an edit message, enter: git commit -m "I changed ____ about this file"
- Enter: git push
- Enter proper credentials upon inquiry
- Confirm that all changes have been pushed by navigating to http://github.com/"your-username-here"/pyBeginner


Thats the basics, now go CODE!
